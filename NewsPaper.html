The company was known both for the level of detail of its engineering in its automobiles, and for the artistic manner in which the designs were executed, given the artistic nature of Ettore's family (his father, Carlo Bugatti (1856–1940), was an important Art Nouveau furniture and jewelry designer).World War I and its aftermath

Bugatti Type 13 Brescia Sport-Racing, 1922
During the war Ettore Bugatti was sent away, initially to Milan and later to Paris, but as soon as hostilities had been concluded he returned to his factory at Molsheim.[2] Less than four months after the Versailles Treaty formalised the transfer of Alsace from Germany to France, Bugatti was able to obtain, at the last minute, a stand at the 15th Paris motor show in October 1919.[2] He exhibited three light cars, all of them closely based on their pre-war equivalents, and each fitted with the same overhead camshaft 4-cylinder 1,368cc engine with four valves per cylinder.[2] Smallest of the three was a "Type 13" with a racing body (constructed by the Bugatti themselves) and using a chassis with a 2,000 mm (78.7 in) wheelbase.[2] The others were a "Type 22" and a "Type 23" with wheelbases of 2,250 and 2,400 mm (88.6 and 94.5 in) respectivel

					<h1>BUGATTI HISTORY: A STORIED PAST</h1>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Before we break down the Bugatti logo, let’s take a brief look at the compelling Bugatti history, from its origins to where it stands today. In 1909, Italian-born automobile designer Ettore Bugatti founded Automobiles Ettore Bugatti in Molsheim: a then-German city which is now a commune in France. Even back then, Bugatti performance vehicles were renowned for their design and their numerous racing victories.

Ettore Bugatti passed away in 1947 and, because his son had passed in 1939, there was no heir to the company. As a result, Automobiles Ettore Bugatti ceased production of its automobiles for several decades.

In the 1990s, an Italian entrepreneur revived the Bugatti brand as a manufacturer of limited production luxury performance cars like the one-off Centodieci: a recently released model with only 10 units made. Many Weston performance vehicle enthusiasts are surprised to learn that today, the Bugatti brand is owned by the Volkswagen Group.</p>

					Volkswagen was founded in Berlin in 1937 and incorporated in Wolfsburg to manufacture the car that would become known as the Beetle. The company's production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1965, it acquired Auto Union, which subsequently produced the first postwar Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the Passat, Polo and Golf; the last became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of Škoda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN, and Porsche in 2012. The company's operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade, with the country becoming its largest market.
